# CoverageChallenge
Romi, Coverage Task, Obstacle Avoidance, Wavefront

## Report Notes
* Wavefront: from middle (may be inefficient, due to too many turns)
* Wavefront: divide map into 4 parts (numbers of turns are still larger than start from middle)
* 两侧 IR sensor 装得太远，对障碍物的检测效果不好，改为靠中间安装
* EEPROM: the maximum memory is 4096-byte (every char is 8-bit/1-byte)
